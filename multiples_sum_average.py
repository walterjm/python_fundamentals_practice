# Part I - Write code that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000. Use the for loop and don't use a list to do this exercise.
# for count in range (1,1001):
#     if count % 2 == 1:
#         print count


#this will print multiples of 5 from 5 to 1 million
# for count in range (5,1000001):
#     if count % 5 == 0:
#         print count


#this will print the sum of all the values in the list
# a = [1,2,5,10,255,3]
# sum_of_numbers = sum(a)
# print sum_of_numbers


#this will give me the average of the numbers in the list
# a = [1,2,5,10,255,3]
# average_of_numbers = sum(a)
# print "Average of numbers is", average_of_numbers / len(a)
